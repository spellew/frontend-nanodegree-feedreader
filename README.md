## UdaciFeeds

### About The Project

*UdaciFeeds* is a website that uses the **Google Feed Reader API** to convert RSS feeds from either **Udacity**, **CSSTricks**, **HTML5 Rocks**, **Linear Digressions**, into JSON, and then displays this feed data as entries. When the user clicks on a feed entry, we'll show them the content relating to that particular entry. Also, the user can change feed using the hamburger menu.

#### Running The Tool 
  0. You should have node and npm installed. https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
  1. In the directory you wish to parent the project, run the `git clone https://github.com/spellew/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git` command. This will copy all the files needed to build the project into a folder called frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.
  2. Next, run the `cd frontend-nanodegree-feedreader` command. This changes your working directory to the folder we just cloned.
  3. Then, run the `npm i` command. This installs all the modules needed to run the project.
  4. Finally, run the `gulp` command. This starts a server that will host all the necessary files. The console will output a **[Secure URL]**, navigate to this URL to access the app.
